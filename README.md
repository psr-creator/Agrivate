# Agrivate
With the exponential growth of world population, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the world will need to produce 70 percentage more food in 2050. With shrinking agri- cultural lands, and depletion of finite natural resources, the need to enhance farm yield has become critical. Limited availability of natural resources such as fresh water and arable land along with slowing yield trends in several sta- ple crops, have further aggravated the problem.Another impeding concern over the farming industry is the shifting structure of agricultural workforce. Moreover, agricultural labor in most of the countries has declined. As a result of the declining agricultural workforce, adoption of internet connectivity so- lutions in farming practices has been triggered, to reduce the need for manual labor. It is a device that determines the soil nutrient levels (Nitrogen, Phos- phorous, Potassium), pH and soil moisture levels in real time. The analysis is done in 3 different soil depths. The data is sent to a cloud server and an- alytics is run on the data based on soil conditions compiled by governments, universities, and the unique criteria from your farm.It gives suggestions on crops to be grown, fertilizers to be used and agriculture related information are provided to the customer via an app.
